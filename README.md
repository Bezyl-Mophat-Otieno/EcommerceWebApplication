# Restaurant Website

This is a web application for a restaurant that allows customers to make orders and keep track of their orders. Customers can browse the menu, select items, add them to their cart, and place orders. The application provides a user-friendly interface for an enhanced ordering experience.

## Features

- **Browse Menu**: Customers can view the restaurant's menu, which includes various categories of food items such as appetizers, main courses, desserts, and beverages.

- **Place Orders**: Customers can review their cart, make modifications if needed, and place their orders. They will be prompted to provide their contact information and delivery details.

- **Order Tracking**: Once an order is placed, customers can track the status of their order. They will receive updates on the progress of their order, such as order confirmation, preparation, and delivery.

- **User Authentication**: The application provides user authentication to ensure secure access to order history and personal information. Customers can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
